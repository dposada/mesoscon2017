# Panel: Mesos in the Enterprise

- engineers doing a really good job at solving "micro" problems - a feature, a bug
- customers are more focused on "macro" problems - what is the product as a whole?
- more focus on the install experience, documentation, the entire customer journey
- what customers want is predictability, reliability
- mesosphere wants a seamless experience for their customers
- the move to cluster computing is a shift in mindset for a lot of people
- UCR is big because it allows you to get rid of the docker daemon
- how can you use mesosphere to handle hybrid cloud/on-premise environments?
